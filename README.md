# Places, Please
`Places, Please` is a comedy stage show written by myself. I
came up with this idea while wrapping up on a production at
my high school alma-matter, and thought I might try to flesh
it out into an actual production. As far as I can tell,
this is the first production of it's kind.

## Synopsis
`Places, Please` follows the production of a generic high
school musical. It's opening night, the stage is set, the
cast is ready, and the audience is packed. The overture
roars, the curtain rises, the stage manager makes the call

> Lights 5 GO

Of course, this is how the show **should** have started.
But for this production, everything that can go wrong,
does!

Join us in this wonderfully backwards comedy, where the
stage is in the wings, and the wings are on the stage, the
cast is the crew, and the crew is the cast!

## Status
This isn't even close to being ready. I'll probably only
have time to work on it in my spare time (I'm not the best
writer and tend to get blocked pretty often).

## Getting a Copy of the Script
This script and all derivative modifications of it will
always be available for free online under the Creative
Commons `BY-NC-SA 4.0` license (see below). Once I get
some pages written, I'll get a build script together to
package this up as a PDF for printing.

### Contributing
Feel free to open an issue against this repository if you
notice a spelling or grammatical error, or if you have a
plot point suggestion. I cannot accept all contributions as
I would still like to keep this work my own, but I will try
to take them all in consideration. If I do use your
suggestion, I'll be sure to mention you in the back of the
script!

If you wish to make a commercial production, or perform
`Places, Please` for a fund-raiser, please open an issue and
we can figure something out. Once I get the script developed
more, I'll add guidelines for requesting commercial rights.
